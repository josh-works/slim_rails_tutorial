As part of some work I'm doing for Alex & Trevor at https://www.teamworkonline.com/, I needed a 'kick the tires' application.

Teamwork online uses the following tools which I'm aiming to integrate as it feels helpful in this tutorial, AKA a guide I'm writing for myself.


```ruby
gem "slim-rails" # https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari
gem "bootstrap"
gem "bootstrap4-kaminari-views"
gem "kaminari", "~> 1.2.1"

```

Follow along here on Github (https://github.com/josh-works/slim_rails_tutorial/tree/main) or on Heroku: https://rails-slim-tutorial.herokuapp.com/.

I'm allocating not a lot of time to this, so lets get started.
